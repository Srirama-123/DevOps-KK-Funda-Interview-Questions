Difference between adduser and useradd:

useradd:

It’s a low-level command used to create a user account.
It requires you to manually specify options like the home directory, shell, etc.
It doesn’t provide prompts or interactive questions.
It's more flexible but requires more input from the user. 

adduser:

It’s a high-level command (often a script) that is easier to use.
It automatically handles creating the home directory, setting the default shell, and asks you for details like the password, full name, etc.
It’s more user-friendly, especially for beginners.
